# Board

I built a couple electronics prototyping boards which have an LCD screen, Volts/Amps/Watts gauges, and an Arduino (328P) to monitor certain aspects (temperature/fan for the regulator).

I plan on posting the schematic at some point.

In front: 7Driver, then a discrete square wave counter, then two prototyping boards w/WiFi + PIC MCU's (this repo). Left: adjustable regulator.
